# CashChecks

With this plugin, you can add cash checks to your server! What a cash check is? It is basically a paper holding some money on it. Count them as a new way of paying to people.

> This plugin requires Vault and an economy plugin inside your server, otherwise the plugin won't work.

## Commands

**/check <amount>** - Get a cash check holding \n<amount> amount of money on it.

## Usage

After you get your cash check with **/check <amount>**, you can use your check as an item that represents money. You can hide it in a chest somewhere, do a little role-play by giving it to your workers instead of **/pay**, or just keep it in your inventory.
To get the money in your check, all you have to do is right click somewhere while holding the check in your main hand. Then, you'll get the money and the check will disappear, if the transaction was successful.
